âš¡ Brandon Opere â€“ DevRel Engineer | AI Tools Architect | Builder at TechOps Apex
This is my personal portfolio site â€” a central hub for everything I build and share.
It showcases my work across AI developer tools, full-stack product engineering, and DevRel content creation.
Built with Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion, and deployed on Vercel for speed and scalability.
